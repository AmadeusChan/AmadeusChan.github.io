### About Me



I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University under the supervision of Prof. Xuehai Qian. Before that, I was a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California, also under the supervision of Prof. Xuehai Qian. I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. My research interests majorly focus on _**mapping challenging workloads, in particular machine learning applications and graph processing applications, to different underlying hardwares efficiently with domain-specific systems**_. You can find my CV [here](https://github.com/AmadeusChan/AmadeusChan.github.io/blob/main/docs/resume.pdf) and my Google Scholar Profiler [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KviNHgEAAAAJ&hl=en).

As a system researcher, I have designed and implemented various high-performance machine learning and graph systems _**(with more than 30K lines of code in total)**_, including a distributed GNN training system (GNNPipe, paper in submission), an efficient and scalable distributed GPM (graph pattern mining) system (Khuzdul, ASPLOS'22), a compilation-based GPM system (DecoMine, ASPLOS'22) and a distributed graph processing system (SympleGraph, PLDI'20/TOCS). I am currently actively working on efficient LLM (large language model) serving systems. I have maintained a (non-comprehensive) list of LLM system papers [here](https://github.com/AmadeusChan/Awesome-LLM-System-Papers), and you are more than welcome to create a PR to update the repo :)

*__I plan to graduate in 2024 and I am actively looking for a industrial research or engineer job or a post-doctoral position. Feel free to reach out if your company/lab has any opening :)__*
